* ====================================*
* -> What?
* The original autonomous pyramid, improved:
* [x] More stable than ever, having withstood severe testnet abuse and attack attempts from our community!.
* [x] Audited, tested, and approved by known community security specialists such as tocsick and Arc.
* [X] New functionality; you can now perform partial sell orders. If you succumb to weak hands, you don't have to dump all of your bags!
* [x] New functionality; you can now transfer tokens between wallets. Trading is now possible from within the contract!
* [x] New Feature: PoS Masternodes! The first implementation of Ethereum Staking in the world! Vitalik is mad.
* [x] Masternodes: Holding 100 PoWH3D Tokens allow you to generate a Masternode link, Masternode links are used as unique entry points to the contract!
* [x] Masternodes: All players who enter the contract through your Masternode have 30% of their 10% dividends fee rerouted from the master-node, to the node-master!
*
* -> What about the last projects?
* Every programming member of the old dev team has been fired and/or killed by 232.
* The new dev team consists of seasoned, professional developers and has been audited by veteran solidity experts.
* Additionally, two independent testnet iterations have been used by hundreds of people; not a single point of failure was found.
* 
* -> Who worked on this project?
* - PonziBot (math/memes/main site/master)
* - Mantso (lead solidity dev/lead web3 dev)
* - swagg (concept design/feedback/management)
* - Anonymous#1 (main site/web3/test cases)
* - Anonymous#2 (math formulae/whitepaper)
*
* -> Who has audited & approved the projected:
* - Arc
* - tocisck
* - sumpunk
